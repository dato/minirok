(This list is obviosly not complete, just here to not forget of these.)

IMPORTANT:
  * As we ship icons, we have to "touch `kde4-config --expandvars
    --install icon`/hicolor", both in setup.sh and postinst! (postrm
    too?)
  * Using util.playable_from_untrusted in load_saved_playlist()
    eliminates duplicates.

Tree View:
  * Use a regex as well to control the appearance of file names?

Playlist:
  * Tabs??
  * Previous button behaves more like a "Back" button: does not go to
    the item above the current item, but to the item played right before
    (think queues and random mode).
  * After clearing a search, the playlist scrolls to the top, which may
    not show the current item as visible.
  * Limiting the search, and removing all visible items, removes all
    non-visible items in between.
  * Allow "read tags when item visible", à-la-xmms?

  * Make Undo preserve stuff like the "stop after".
  * Make Undo/Redo preserve the selection?

  * Center-align the track column, and right-align the length column.

UI:
  * connect track change / playlist change with statusbar and caption

Statusbar:
  * <Ganneff> is it possible to get a "you have XXX songs in this
    playlist" info somewhere in the display? maybe with an added "this is
    5 hours of noise"

Options:
  * First radio button properly vertically aligned

Appearance:
  * Draw column separators in the playlist? (HOWTO: playlistitem.cpp:595)
    And, only in the Amarok classic theme, or always?

Other:
  * Save window position?, maybe use a meaningful size the first time
  * It'd be nice to have module and line numbers in logging output, but
    it doesn't seem to work.
  * Read directory contents in a separate thread, as we do with tags.
    But probably when ported to Qt4, see:
      http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2008-January/018103.html
  * Use __slots__ for TreeViewItems?
