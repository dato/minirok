Installing instructions
=======================

If you want to install Minirok from source (instead of installing
packages from your distribution), run `./setup.sh install`.

That will install files under the appropriate locations as determined by
kde4-config. If the kde4-config binary can't be found, installation will
be aborted.

However, Minirok should run just fine from the unpacked source
directory, with just `./minirok.py` (you can make a symlink to that
from eg. ~/bin/minirok).
